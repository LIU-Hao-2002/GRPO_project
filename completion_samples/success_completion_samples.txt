<think>First, I need to use all three numbers exactly once to get 56. I can start by looking at the highest number, 63, and see if I can make it closer to 56 without exceeding it. If I subtract a number, I can then add a number that brings the total back to around 56.</think>
<answer>(63 - 32) + 25 = 56</answer>

==============
<think>First, I should try to get 31 using the numbers we have. 83 might be tricky on its own, so let's try subtracting 91 to get a smaller result. 83 - 91 = -8 </think>
<answer>(83 - 91) + 39 = 31</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use 39 and 91 to get close to 31. Both numbers are close to 30, so I'll try to subtract or add them to 83.</think>
<answer>(83 - 91) + 39 = 31</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the largest number, 52, to get as close to 67 as possible without exceeding it. 52 + 2 = 54, which is close but not quite there.</think>
<answer>(52 + 2) - (29 - 42) = 67</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use 42, 29, and 52. If I add 2 to 52, I get 54, which is close to 67. If I then subtract 29 from 54, I get 25. Now, I just need to add 42 to 25 to get 67.</think>
<answer>(52 + 2) - 29 + 42 = 67</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to get close to 87 using the numbers we have:</think>
<answer>(59 - 18) + 46 = 87</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try adding the largest number to one of the smaller numbers:</think>
<answer>(75 + 16) - 54 = 37</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try a simple addition or subtraction:</think>
<answer>(88 - 66) + 57 = 79</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's see if we can use some simple addition or subtraction:</think>
<answer>(86 - 23) + 33 = 96</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll think of how to get as close to 22 as possible using the given numbers:</think>
<answer>(96 - 85) + 11 = 22</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use one of the numbers as a base number for the equation:</think>
<answer>(9 - 8) * 36 = 36</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try using division:</think>
<answer>(88 - 66) + 57 = 79</answer>

==============
<think>First, I will think of a combination of the numbers that can add up to 79:</think>
<answer>(88 - 66) + 57 = 79</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use some addition or subtraction to get close to 35:</think>
<answer>(41 - 26) + 20 = 35</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use subtraction to get as close to 56 as possible:</think>
<answer>(63 - 32) + 25 = 56</answer>

==============
<think>First, I will try subtracting some numbers to get close to 56:</think>
<answer>(63 - 32) + 25 = 56</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to get as close to 79 as possible using the numbers I have: [88, 66, 57]</think>
<answer>(88 - 66) + 57 = 79</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to see if I can get close to 76 using the numbers I have:</think>
<answer>(69 - 33) + 40 = 76</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use subtraction to get close to 79:</think>
<answer>(88 - 66) + 57 = 79</answer>

==============
<think>First I'll try some simple operations:</think>
<answer>(68 - 56) + (54 / 1) = 66</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try using subtraction and addition since we're given numbers close to 37:</think>
<answer>(75 - 54) + 16 = 37</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try simple operations:</think>
<answer>(90 - 80) + 62 = 72</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try adding and subtracting:</think>
<answer>(91 - 88) + 90 = 93</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to get close to 93 using the numbers we have:</think>
<answer>(91 - 88) + 90 = 93</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use all the numbers once:</think>
<answer>(85 - 62) + 10 = 33</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use as many numbers as possible without exceeding 37:</think>
<answer>(20 - 19) + 53 - 17 = 37</answer>

==============
<think>First, I will try to use all the numbers:</think>
<answer>(86 - 23) + 33 = 96</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use some basic operations to get closer to 36:</think>
<answer>(9 - 8) * 36 = 36</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try adding and subtracting:</think>
<answer>(59 - 18) + 46 = 87</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to see if I can use one of the numbers as is:</think>
<answer>(63 - 32) + 25 = 56</answer>
