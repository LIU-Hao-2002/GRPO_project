# Reproducing and generalizing DeepSeekMath

## Introduction
This project is a personal learning process of the paper "DeepSeekMath: A Large-Scale Dataset and Model for Math Problem Solving" by DeepSeek AI. The goal is to understand the paper, learn GRPO, reproduce the results and generalize the training algorithm.

## Credits
The code used in this project mainly comes from the following repositories:
- For reproducing paper results: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Math.git
- For GRPO and DPO training: https://github.com/philschmid/deep-learning-pytorch-huggingface.git
Appreciation to your remarkable work.
