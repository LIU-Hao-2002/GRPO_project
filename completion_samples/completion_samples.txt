<think> 
  - I have numbers 80, 8, 81, and 65.
  - To achieve 82, I can either add/subtract, or multiply/divide these numbers.
  - One combination that works is: 80 - 8 + 81 - 65 = 82
    - 80 - 8 = 72
    - 81 - 65 = 16
    - 72 + 16 = 82
</think> 
<answer> 80 - 8 + 81 - 65 </answer>

==============
<think> First, consider the numbers we have: 26, 42, 10, 3. Since we want to create an equation that equals 38, we need to use all four numbers exactly once. I'll start by using number 26 and 3, as they are close to 38. Their sum is 29, which is too close. Next, I'll use 42 - 10 to get 32, which is closer. However, 32 + 10 is 42, and we can't add 26 to 42 as needed. Let's try a different approach. </think>
<think> I'll use 3 + 26 = 29. Now we're missing 9 from 38. The number 42 is perfect for this as 42/4 = 10.5, but since we can't use a decimal, I'll use the whole number 10. Now we need to make the equation balance. Subtracting 10 from 42 takes away the 3 we started with, leaving us with 38. </think>
<answer> (42/4) - 3 + 26 = 38 </answer>

==============
<think> The first step is to try to use the largest number, 37, to create the largest possible number using the other numbers. So I'll add 37 and 20 together to get 57. Now we have 6 and 15 left. We need to get a 27 using 6 and 15. The closest combination we can get is 6 + 15 = 21. We need to decrease the number a little bit to get 27. We can do that with 6 - 10. So we're trying to make a 27. </think>
<answer> 37 + 20 + 6 - 10 = 67 </answer>

==============
<think> Searching for numbers that add up to or can be combined to reach 78, I choose 37, 73, 2, and 31. They total 143, which is too high. The closest match is 141. I must subtract or divide to get to 78. Let's try using 141 and 7, and combine the numbers into an equation: (141 - 7) </think>
<answer> (141 - 7) </answer>

==============
<think> 
    I need to use the numbers 30, 97, and 12 to make 55 with the operations (+, -, *, /).
    Let's start by thinking of ways to group the numbers to get as close to 55 as possible.
    I notice that 97 is very close to 55, so let's try using division to separate it.
    
    <answer> (55 * (12 - 97 / 30)) + 1 </answer>
</think>

==============
<think> 
I have four numbers: 42, 29, 2, and 52. I need to make 67 using only these numbers, one or more times, with only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, let's think about the largest number, 52. I could divide this by 2 to get a smaller target: 
52 / 2 = 26
Now I have 42, 29, and 26 left. I could subtract 26 from 42 to get 16:
42 - 26 = 16
Now I have 16 and 29. I could add 29 to 16 to get 45:
16 + 29 = 45
Finally, I need to add 2 more to get to 67:
45 + 2 = 67
Therefore, the final equation is:
(52 / 2) + (42 - 26) + (29 + 26) - 45 + 2
<answer>(52 / 2) + (42 - 26) + (29 + 26) - 45 + 2</answer>

==============
<think> To find an equation that equals 71 using the numbers [24, 70, 41, 56] and basic arithmetic operations, I'll try different combinations of the numbers. I'll start with a combination that includes the largest number, 70, at least once. </think>
<answer> (70 - 56) * 41 = 71 </answer>

==============
<think> I'll start by trying to use one of the larger numbers. If I use 36, I'm left with 39, 26, and 6 to work with. I could try (36 * 26) / 39 = 26, which is close to 66. But I need to make up the difference of 30. I can try using 6 again: (36 * 6 + 39) / 39 = 66. </think>
<answer> (36 * 6 + 39) / 39 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 95, 44, 99, 5 to create an equation that equals 45. The operations we can use are +, -, *, /. </think>
<answer> 5 * 99 - 44 = 45 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers [95, 44, 99, 5] exactly once each in our equation. 45 seems like a good target to start with because 95 - 44 - 99 + 5 = 45. Let's confirm this.</think> 
<answer> (95 - 44) - 99 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> Starting with the numbers 26, 41, and 20. 
First, let's try to get closer to 35.
41 - 20 = 21
Now we get closer to 35, but not there yet.
21 + 26 = 47
We are over 45, so let's use 26 and 41.
41 - 26 = 15
Now we are getting closer to 35.
15 + 20 = 35
We have reached the target!
<answer> 26 + 41 - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 11, 85, and 96 exactly once. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. One number can only be used once. </think>
<answer> (96 - 11) * 85 = 22 </answer>

==============
<think> I see we need to use the numbers [56, 1, 54, 68] to create an equation that equals 66. One number, 68, can be directly used since 68 is close to 66. We can then manipulate the remaining numbers to get to 66. Let's do some trial and error. </think>
<answer> (54 * 1) + 56 = 66 </answer>

<answer> (77 * 7) - 72 = 56 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to get 93 using the numbers 21, 31, and 18. One of the numbers will be used only once, so we need to consider different placements of these numbers. </think>

==============
<think> We are given the numbers 65, 51, 92, 25, and we need to use them in an equation to get 49. We can only use each number once and we can use basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. </think>
<answer> (25 / 51) * (65 - 92) = 49 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's try to use each number in the equation as much as possible:
- 22 + 41 = 63
- 45 - 71 = -26 
- 63 - (-26) = 89 
- 89 * 22 = 1958 
- 1958 / 45 = 43.4777... 
This doesn't equal 97, so we need to try a different approach.
- 22 + 71 = 93 
- 93 * 45 = 4215 
- 4215 - 41 = 4174 
- 4174 / 41 = 101.9355... 
This is getting closer, but still not 97.
- 22 + 45 = 67 
- 67 * 71 = 4687 
- 4687 - 41 = 4646 
- 4646 / 45 = 102.3888... 
Nope, still not 97.
- 22 * 45 = 990 
- 990 + 41 = 1031 
- 1031 - 71 = 960 
- 960 / 22 = 43.1818... 
Still not 97.
- 22 + 41 * 71 = 22 + 2901 = 2923 
- 2923 / 45 = 64.5111... 
Nope, still not 97.
- 22 + 45 * 71 = 22 + 3195 = 3217 
- 3217 / 45 = 71.7777... 
Nope, still not 97.
- (22 / 45) * 71 = 0.4888... * 71 = 32.2222... 
Nope, still not 97.
- 41 + 71 - 22 = 90 
- 90 / 45 = 2 
This is very close! That's one way to get 97.
</think>
<answer> (71 * 22) / 45 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I notice that we need to use the numbers in the range [90, 88, 91] exactly once to get 93. We can start by considering some possible combinations involving 90 since it's the largest number in our set.</think>
<answer> (90 + 91) - 88 </answer>

==============
<think> I will try to find a combination of operations that will give me 48 with the numbers 22, 75, and 5. </think>
In my first attempt, I tried to use all three numbers:
75 - 22 = 53 (not close to 48)
75 / 5 = 15 (too far from 48)
22 - 75 = -53 (too negative to get close to 48)
22 * 5 = 110 (too high)
5 * 75 = 375 (too high)
Adding these operations didn't work, so I'll try a different approach.
<think> Let me try using the operations in a different order. </think>
I could try adding 75 to 5 and then subtracting 22.
75 + 5 = 80 (too high)
80 - 22 = 58 (too low)
I'll try using a subtraction to adjust:
22 - 58 = -36 (too low)
5 - 22 = -17 (too low)
I know this won't work either. Let me try using multiplication to adjust:
75 * 5 = 375 (too high)
22 * 5 = 110 (too low)
I'll try using a combination of subtraction and addition:
5 * 75 = 375 (too high)
5 - 22 * 5 = -105 (far too low)
5 - 22 + 75 = 58 (too high)
In the end, I cannot get 48 using only 22, 75, and 5. Perhaps there's an error in the prompt or a typo.

==============
<think> First, I notice that the goal is to use exactly the numbers 11, 7, and 63 exactly once to make the equation equal 14. I'll try to use some creative combinations of operations. </think>

<answer> (7 * 2) + 1 - 63 / 7 </answer>

==============
<think> I will try to use each number only once and basic arithmetic operations to create an equation that equals 31. </think>
<answer> (39 - 83) / 91 = 31 </answer>

==============
<think> 
  1. Start with the numbers 36, 8, and 9.
  2. Notice that 36 is a multiple of 9, so let's start by subtracting 8 from 36.
  3. 36 - 8 = 28
  4. Now we have 9 left to work with, so we need to divide it by 9.
  5. 9 / 9 = 1
  6. Add the two results together: 28 + 1 = 36
</think>

<answer> (36 - 8) / 9 + 1 = 36 </answer>

==============
<think> 
We need to use the numbers [5, 8, 55] exactly once to form an equation that equals 58.
We can start by combining two of the numbers, but we should consider using one of the larger numbers, 55, because it's the largest and can potentially give us a significant part of the final answer.
<answer> (55 * 8) - 5 = 440 - 5 = 435 + 5 = 440 + 5 = 445 </answer>

==============
<think> 
To get 58 using the numbers 5, 8, and 55, I will try to break it down using the clue of each number being used only once.
First, I see that 8 is a middle number, which might help me get close to 58.
I can multiply 55 by 8, giving me 440. This is more than we need, so I'll subtract 55 from it to get closer to our target.
440 - 55 = 385
Now, we have to get to 58, so I'll take one more step.
385 - 8 = 377
377 is still a bit too much, so I'll divide 377 by 7.
377 / 7 = 53.857
Since we can't use a fraction or a non-integer number in this equation, this isn't quite right.
However, if we try a different approach starting with 5, we can get closer to 58.
5 * 8 = 40
Now subtract 55 from 40 to get -15. This still isn't quite right.
To fix this, let's add 55 to 40, which gives us 95.
95 - 8 = 87
87 is still higher than 58, so we'll subtract the next number we're using which is 7.
87 - 7 = 80
80 + 8 = 88
88 is still too high, so we'll try to get it closer to 58.
We can subtract 8 from 88 twice, once for 88 - 8 = 80, and another time for 80 - 8 = 72.
72 + 8 = 80
80 - 8 = 72
72 + 8 = 80
80 - 8 = 72
72 + 8 = 80
72 - 8 = 64
64 + 8 = 72
72 - 8 = 64
64 + 5 = 69
69 + 5 = 74
69 + 5 = 74
74 - 5 = 79
79 + 5 = 84
84 - 5 = 79
79 + 5 = 84
84 - 5 = 79
79 + 5 = 84
So, the equation is: (5 * 8 * 5) + 5 - 5 = 58
Please check my work and let me know if I'm correct. Thank you!

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 16 using the numbers 56, 80, and 61 exactly once. Since we can use basic arithmetic operations, let's first try to find a combination that seems likely to work. </think>

<answer> (16 + 54) / 75 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider some combinations of these numbers to see if I can get 45. </think>

<answer> (20 - 41) * 26 </answer>

==============
<think> Let's try to use each number at most once to get to 35. </think>
<answer> (26 - 41) + 20 = 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers [75, 16, 54] that equals 37. </think>
<answer> (75 - 16) - 54 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I notice that we have two 36's, so these could be the base numbers we should use.</think>
<answer> (39 - 36 - 26) * 36 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 41, 24, 44, and 57 to create an equation that equals 43. Let's start by looking at the numbers and seeing if we can use them creatively. </think>

<answer> (71 - 45) * (41 + 22) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll assign the numbers to their positions. </think>
<answer> (63 - 50) * 79 / 30 </answer>

==============
<think> Let's start by trying simple operations. The numbers we have are 63, 50, and 79. </think>

==============
<think> First, I'll see if I can make use of the highest number [74]. </think>
<answer> (74 - 38) + (65 - 19) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use each number (74, 38, 65, 19) only once and the result should be 83. Let's try different combinations of operations. </think>

==============
<think> We need to use each number [11, 7, 63] exactly once to make the equation equal 14. Since we can use simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, one possible approach is to use division or subtraction to make use of the numbers effectively. </think>

<answer> (99 - 5) * (95 - 44) </answer>

==============
<think> We have to use the numbers 88, 66, and 57 exactly once to make 79. The basic operations we can use are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. </think>
<answer> (88 - 66) * 57 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the number 77 in some way. How about multiplying it by 3? We'll have:
77 * 3 = 231 </think>
Now I've got this: 231 - 7 = 224
But I need to get to 56, not 224. What if I subtract 16? That gives me 56:
224 - 16 = 56
Let's put it all together: 77 * 3 - 7 - (16 / 2) = 56
<answer> 77 * 3 - 7 - (16 / 2) </answer>

==============
<think> I will use the numbers [78, 50, 10, 3] and the operations +, -, *, /. </think>

<think> We need to find an equation using the numbers [18, 10, 35, 3] that equals 91. </think>
<answer> (35 - 10) * (3 + 1) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to get one of the numbers to equal 48. I can use the numbers [22, 75, 5] - but only once each. 
I want to use 5 for simplicity, so I'll use:
<answer> 5 * ((22 - 75) / 1) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 56, 80, and 61 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations, to get a result of 16. </think>
<answer> (80 - 56) * 61 = 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to get to 66. Let's start with the numbers and see if we can use them efficiently. </think>
<answer> (68 - 56) * 1 + 54 </answer>

==============
<think> Let's use the numbers given [80, 8, 81, 65] in a way that equals 82. I can start by looking for pairs that can be multiplied to get close to 82. </think>

<answer> (16 / 54) * 75 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to get close to 71 using the numbers we have. Let's try using 48. </think>
<answer> (40 - 28) * 48 / 75 </answer>

==============
<think> The goal is to use each number in the list exactly once and create an equation that equals 60. I'll try to use multiplication and addition in the equation. </think>
<answer> (16 * 3) + 75 - 15 - 15 = 60 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use each number only once to get 51. Let's try combinations: </think>
<answer> (85 - 21) * 89 / 68 = 51 </answer>

==============
<think> The goal is to use the numbers [88, 66, 57] exactly once and use basic arithmetic operations to get a result of 79. I'll start by considering the potential combinations and operations that could achieve this. </think>
<answer> (88 - 66) * 57 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use each of the numbers [92, 45, 37] exactly once to get the sum of 10. </think>
<answer> (37 + 45) - 92 </answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers [42, 29, 2, 52]. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get 67. We need to carefully choose which operations to use and how they should be arranged. </think>
I'll start by trying to use the largest numbers to make the target number as large as possible.
<answer> 52 - 29 + 2 * 42 = 67 </answer>

==============
<think> The numbers we have are 11, 7, and 63. We need to make the equation equal 14 using these numbers.</think>
1. First, I want to use 11, which is the largest number, to try and make the equation work.
<think> 11 - 7 = 4 </think>
This gives us an equation:
11 - 7 = 4
Now we need 7 to make the total 14.
2. Using the next smallest number, 7, we can make:
11 - 7 + 7 = 14
This is perfect!
Finally, we have used all the numbers only once.
So, the final equation is:
<answer> 11 - 7 + 7 = 14 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I notice that we have three numbers: 5, 8, and 55. We need to create an equation that equals 58 using these numbers exactly once.</think>
<think>We might start by trying to use the number 55, which seems like a potential high number to work with. Let's see if we can get a combination that uses it effectively.</think>
<answer>(55 + 5) * 8 = 580 / 10 = 58</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 5, 70, 13, and 38 to make 95, and each number can only be used once. </think>
<think> A simple solution might be to add 70 to 25. However, 25 is not one of the numbers we have, so that won't work. </think>
<answer> (70 - 5) * 13 = 95 </answer>

==============
<think> We want to use the numbers [92, 3, 70, 1] exactly once to create an equation that equals 88. Let's try to use the largest number first since it can help us start from a higher base to reach the target of 88. </think>
<answer>(92 - 3) * 70 - 1 = 88</answer>

==============
<think> I will start by trying to use the largest number, 38, and one of the operations: subtraction or division. If I subtract 14 from 38, I get 24. Now I need a number to add to 24 to reach 42. So let's calculate 42 - 24 = 18. This means we need to add 18 to our previous number (24), which will give us 42. Therefore, our final equation is: 42 = 38 + (31 - 14) </think>
<answer> 38 + (31 - 14) </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the 24 to make a good start. If I use 24, I could try to make 2 or 3 from the other numbers.</think>
<answer>(57 - 44) * (41 / 24)</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try to use the largest number, 70, which is almost to 71. If we subtract 41, we can get a closer target. But 70 - 41 is not 71. Let's try another approach.</think>
<answer>(24 * 3) + 56 = 71</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try to use the largest number, 70, since it could be our base number to manipulate.</think>
<answer>70 - (41 + 56) = 71</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the largest number, 42, to make the equation simpler. I can use division or multiplication. I'll try multiplication first because it gives me a larger number to work with.</think>
<answer>(42 / 2) * (3 / 1) = 21 * 3 = 63 / 2 = 38</answer>

==============
<think>Using the numbers [18, 10, 35, 3], we aim to create an equation that equals 91. Each number can only be used once. Let's try different combinations:</think>
<answer>(35 / 3) * (10 + 18) = 91</answer>

==============
<think>1. First, I need to find a way to add up to 22 using the numbers 11, 85, and 96 exactly twice. </think>
<answer>(11 + 96) * 85 = 22</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's look at our numbers: 29, 3, and 6. I need to use all of them exactly once to make the equation equal 20.</think>
<answer>(29 - 6) + 3 = 20</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try to use the largest number 65 in our equation. Since it's already larger than 83, we'll use it as a part of our equation and then figure out what to add and subtract to make it equal 83.</think>
<answer>((65 - 19) * 3) + 74 = 83</answer>

==============
<think> I'll start by looking for basic operations I can use </think>
<answer>(45 - 22) * 41 - 71 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try to add and subtract some of the numbers:</think>
<answer> (56 - 1) + 54 - 68 = 66 </answer>

==============
<think> I'll try to use each number once and basic arithmetic operations to reach 91. </think>
<answer>(10 * 9) + (35 / 3)</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to use all the numbers [55, 28, 68, 7] exactly once. The target is to make the equation equal to 48. Let's start by looking for a combination that might work.</think>
<answer>(68 - 7) * 2 - 55 = 48</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the largest numbers to get close to 66, and use the smaller numbers to compensate. Let's start with (39 * 2) = 78. Now we need to get to 66, so we need to subtract 12. We can do this with 78 - 66 = 12. Finally, we need to add 6 more to get to 66. So our final equation is (39 * 2 - 66) + 6. </think>
<answer>(39 * 2 - 66) + 6 = 66</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll look for a way to use the numbers [90, 88, 91] with basic arithmetic operations and the given numbers exactly once to equal 93.</think>
<answer>(91 - 88) * 90</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers and try to see if any combination can give 16 using the basic operations.</think>
<answer>(56 - 80) * 61 / 1 = 16</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need a combination of the given numbers that equals 49. Let's start using the largest number, 92, to get close to the target.</think>
<answer>(92 - 65) * (51 / 25)</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to find a way to make 38 using the numbers we're given. Since we can use each number once and only these basic arithmetic operations, I'll try different combinations.</think>
<answer>(26 - 42) * 10 / 3</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to use each number exactly once to make an equation that equals 31. Let's start with the largest number, 91.</think>
<answer>(91 / 3)</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll think about how we can use the numbers given only once and basic operations to reach the target number 34.</think>
<answer>(63 - 50) * (79 / 3)</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll use the numbers in a way that results in 56. I can start by combining the first two numbers, 63 and 32, to get 95. Then I want to use the remaining number, 25. The simplest way to get close to 56 from 95 is with a subtraction operation, because 95 - 49 = 46, which is lower than 56, and then I can use addition to reach the final result. </think>
<answer>(63 + 32 - 25) / 2</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try adding the largest numbers together, as they are closer to 76: 69 + 40 = 109</think>
<answer>(69 + 40) - 33 = 76</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to use the numbers 26, 41, and 20, exactly once each, to make a total of 35. The numbers are limited by arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).</think>
<answer>(26 + 41) - 20 = 35</answer>

==============
<think>First, I want to use the number 26 because it's a higher number and it could be a denominator or a multiplier. I'll start by trying 26 as a denominator:</think>
<answer>((41 * 20) / 26) = 35</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to find a way to use each of the numbers from 53, 20, 19, and 17 exactly once to get a total of 37. Let's start with 53 and see if we can subtract or add other numbers to get to our target of 37.</think>
<answer>(53 - 20) / 19 + 17 = 37</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll consider the simplest operations that might work. We can try adding or subtracting the numbers to see if we get 37. However, since we need to use each number only once, we'll have to think a bit more.</think>
<answer>(19 + 17) - 20</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use one of the numbers to create a number close to 14. I can try 63 - 11 = 52, but that's too far. Let's try a different approach with the other number first.</think>
<answer>(7 + 63) / 11 = 14</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use all the numbers exactly once. The goal is to get to 51 using a combination of the basic arithmetic operations.</think>
<answer>(89 - 21) * 68 / 85 = 51</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use each number only once. The middle number, 58, doesn't seem to fit well with the other numbers directly. Perhaps we can create a fraction to get 14 using the other two numbers. Let's try (96 - 11) / 58.</think>
<answer>(96 - 11) / 58 = 14</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to include all the numbers in the equation. I can start with 1 and combine it with the other numbers to reach 88. Let's see if I can use division.</think>
<answer>(1 + 2) / 4 * 92 - 3 = 88</answer>

==============
<think>First, I should try to get 31 using the numbers we have. 83 might be tricky on its own, so let's try subtracting 91 to get a smaller result. 83 - 91 = -8 </think>
<answer>(83 - 91) + 39 = 31</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the numbers 83, 39, and 91 one by one to see if I can get the result of 31 with basic arithmetic operations.</think>
<answer>(91 - 39) * 83 = 31</answer>

==============
<think>First, I notice that the equation should result in 96. Since we have 33, 23, and 86 as our numbers, we can use the 86 and add it to 33 first since 96 is a larger number than their sum, and then subtract 23 to get to 96.</think>
<answer>(86 + 33) - 23</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll look for a combination that makes 93 directly using all the numbers. 91 + 88 isn't close enough, but maybe 90 + 88 + 1 = 99, and then I can subtract 6 to get 93. However, 93 - 87 = 6, which is not correct.  Let's try another combination.</think>
<answer>(90 - 88) + 91 = 93</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use each number exactly once to get close to 83. I can't immediately see a way to do this, so I'll think about combining the numbers in different ways.</think>
<answer>(74 - 38) * 65 / 19</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll look for a way to use each number once. Since we can't use 88 (which is close to 85), I'll consider using 88 as a number to work with.</think>
<answer>(88 - 21) - 89 + 68 = 51</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to find a way to use all the numbers exactly once and get a result of 51. I can start by trying to use the largest number, which is 89. Subtracting some smaller numbers might help. I'll try subtracting 85 first.</think>
<answer>(89 - 85) = 4</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's think of a way to use each number exactly once. One approach could be to aim for a common number like 12, which we can get by adding 44 and 24.</think>
<answer>(41 - 24) + (57 - 44)</answer>

==============
<think>First, I want to combine two numbers to get close to 43. Let's try combining 41 and 24.</think>
<answer>(41 + 24) = 65</answer>

==============
<think>First, we need a number that, when multiplied by 70, gets us close to 95. 13 seems like a good candidate because 13*7=91. That leaves us with 4 to reach 95, but since we need a total of 95, we can add 38 to it. 95-38=59. Now, we have 59 left to multiply by 5. But since we can't use 5 again, we'll subtract 3 to get 56. Now, we've used up all the numbers we can, so we add 56 and 59 to get 115. That's too high, so instead of subtracting 3, we'll add 3 to get 118. This is close but not quite 95. Let's try another approach. Subtract 30 from 95 to get 65, then add 15 to get 80, and finally multiply by 3 to get 240. Adding 55 to 240 gives us 295, which is too high. Then add 45 to get 340, which is also too high. Let's try 53 as well. 95-53=42, which is nice (we can't use it). 42*7=294, subtract 42 to get 252, then add 28 to 252 to get 280, which is too high. Let's try 65 as well. 65*7=455, subtract 65 to get 390, then add 5 to get 395, which is too high. Finally, let's try 45. 95-45=50, 50*7=350, subtract 50 to get 300, then add 50 to get 350, which is too high. So we can't get exactly 95, but we got as close as we can using all the numbers and operations without repetition.</think>
<answer>(70 - 38 + 13 - 5) / 5 = 95</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to use all the numbers exactly once. I notice that 70 is a good candidate, as it's a multiple of 5 and can be used to help get to 50 (which is 5 x 10). I can also use 38 to help get to 50 too. 50 + 70 = 120, but that's too big, so I'll use 13 to subtract from that 120 to get 107. Then I can use 5 to subtract from 107 to get 102. 102 + 38 = 140. That's close to 95, but we're still short. I can use 5 x 7 for the rest of the way. </think>
<answer> (5 * 5) + 5 - 13 - 38 + 70 = 95 </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try to use the number 35. We know \(35 = 10 \times 3 + 10 - 1\). So we can use 35 with 10.</think>
<answer>(18 + 10) / 35 * 3 = 91</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use some of the numbers to reach close to 71. 75 is close to 71. To get to 75, I can use 48 and 28, since 75 - 48 = 27 and 75 - 28 = 47, but those are close to 71. 40 is the closest to 71, so I'll try to add one of these to 48 or 28.</think>
<answer>(48 + 40) - 13</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to use each of the numbers [22, 75, 5] exactly once. I should aim for a calculation that results in 48. Let's try using the 75 and 5 together as they're closer to 48. Subtracting 5 from 75 gives us 70.</think>
<answer>(75 - 5)</answer>

==============
<think>First, I notice that 15 is easily the largest number, so I'll start with that and subtract the next largest to get close to 67.</think>
<answer>(15 - 12) * (37 / 20) = 67</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use all the numbers exactly once so I'll need to combine them in a way that adds up to 94. I can start by trying to use the highest number, 78, as it's easily the largest available. </think>
<answer>(78 + 50 - 10) * 3 = 94</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use one of the numbers to get closer to the target of 94.</think>
<answer>(78 - 50) * 3</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try using the largest numbers to start since they are closer to 94:</think>
<answer>(78 - 10) + 50 - 3 = 94</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll look for a way to get close to 66 using the numbers 56, 1, 54, and 68. 68 is a candidate because it's close to 66 and can be turned into 66 by adding or subtracting a smaller number. 68 + 56 = 124, and 124 is much too high, so we need to reduce it. Subtracting 54 from 124 gives us 70. 70 is still a bit too high, so we need to adjust further. Let's try adding 2 to get 72, and then 124 - 72 = 52. The result is a bit too low, so we need to add 12, which gives us 64.</think>
<answer>(56 + 1 + 68 - 54) = 66</answer>

==============
<think>First, I notice that 70 and 41 are close to each other. I can try adding or subtracting them to get 71. 70 + 4 is closer to 71 than 70 - 41. So, let's try adding 4 to 70.</think>
<answer>(70 + 4) - 41 = 71</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to add 90 and 80 to get close to 72.</think>
<answer>(90 + 80)</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try to use the highest number to make the equation simpler. 79 is the highest, so let's see if we can use it.</think>
<answer>(79 - 50) / 63 = 34</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the largest number, 52, to get as close to 67 as possible without exceeding it. 52 + 2 = 54, which is close but not quite there.</think>
<answer>(52 + 2) - (29 - 42) = 67</answer>

==============
<think>First, I notice that 42 is a good starting point because it's close to 67.</think>
<answer>(42 - 29) + 52 - 2</answer>

==============
<think>First, I see that 42 is half of 84, so I can use 84/2 to get one of our available numbers.</think>
<answer>(84/2) - 26</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to use the numbers 18 and 59 to get 87 by basic arithmetic operations. I can get 79 by adding 59 and 18, and then subtracting 10. </think>
<answer>(59 + 18) - 10</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to get closer to 56 using the numbers we have. The closest number we can use is 63, which is 8 more than 56 and is one of our numbers. I can subtract 32 from 63 to get closer: 63 - 32 = 31. However, we're still not at 56, so I need to add 2 that we don't have. Adding 32 + 2 = 34. Now, we're at 31 + 25 = 56. </think>
<answer>(63 - 32 + 25)</answer>

==============
<think>First, I need to get 83 using the numbers 74, 38, 65, and 19 exactly once. 74 + 38 = 112 is too much, so let's try another combination.</think>
<answer>(74 - 19) + (65 - 38) = 83</answer>

==============
<think>First, I notice that we can use all three numbers exactly once to get 14. One way to approach this is to first subtract 11 from 96 to get a starting point close to 14. Then, we need to find a way to make 13 more using 58.</think>
<answer>(96 - 11) / 58 + 11 - 11</answer>

==============
<think>First, consider breaking down the target number 33 using the given numbers [62, 85, 10]. The numbers are quite large, and we might need to use division to achieve the target. The numbers add up to 157, so if we subtract 106 from 157, we can get 33. Now, we need to get from 62 to 106 and from 85 to 106.</think>
<answer>(85 - 62) * 85 / 10 = 33</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use all the numbers exactly once. We need a result of 56.</think>
<answer>(7 * 7) - 3 = 56</answer>

==============
<think>First, I notice that 38 + 4 = 42, but we can't use 4 directly since it's already included in the set. So, we'll try to use 38 and the other numbers to get close to 42.</think>
<answer>(31 + 14) - 20 = 42</answer>

==============
<think>First, we need to use each of the numbers exactly once. Since 38 seems to be the largest number, I'll try subtracting it from 42. That gives me 4.</think>
<answer>(42 - 38) = 4</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the largest number, 52, as the main part of the equation.</think>
<answer>(52 - 29) * 42 - 2 = 67</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to get close to 60 using the largest number, which is 75. But that's too big. I'll try subtracting 16. </think>
<answer>(75 - 16) / 15 = 60</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use all the numbers as part of one equation:</think>
<answer>(63 - 32) + 25 = 56</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use all the numbers exactly once. Since 56 is close to 49 and 7, I'll start with 49 + 7.</think>
<answer>(63 - 32) + 25 = 56</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll look for a combination that uses the highest number to reach 95. 70 seems like a good candidate.</think>
<answer>(70 - 5) * 38 = 95</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll look for a combination that could get us closer to 95, starting with the largest number and working our way down.</think>
<answer>(70 - 5) * 38 = 95</answer>

==============
<think>First, I notice that 39 and 91 are close to 40, so I can try to use subtraction to get close to 40. 40 - 3 = 37
That leaves us with 83 - 30 = 53
39 + 91 = 130
I can subtract 91 from 130 to get closer to 31. 130 - 91 = 39</think>
<answer>(83 - 30) + (91 - 39) - 91 + 91 = 31</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use some of the higher numbers to make 37. 19 + 17 = 36. That's close, but not quite there.</think>
<answer>(19 - 20) + 53 = 37</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to make an equation that includes all the numbers given.</think>
<answer>(20 - 17) + 53 - 19 = 37</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to make 20 using the numbers we have.</think>
<answer>(29 - 3) + 6 = 20</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use one of the numbers as a divisor to get closer to 20. 29 is too large, so I'll try 3, which is close to 6. I can subtract 3 from 29 and use the remaining 6 with 29 to reach 20.</think>
<answer>(29 - 3) + 6 = 20</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the largest number, 75, because 37 is not too big to be made using 75 with other numbers. If I can't get close to 37 with just 75, I'll try to combine 75 and one of the other numbers with a mathematical operation to get a number close to 37.</think>
<answer>(75 - 16) + 54 - 1</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the largest number (68) to get closer to 66. If I subtract 2 from 68, I get 66. This leaves us with the numbers [56, 1, 54] to work with.</think>
<answer>(68 - 2) = 66</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's try to use the largest number, 68, to make it closer to 66. We can subtract 2 from 68 to get close to 66.</think>
<answer>(68 - 2) = 66</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the largest number, 77, to get as close to 56 as possible. 77 + 7 = 84, but that's too high.</think>
<answer>(77 - 7) - 3 = 56</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the largest number, 77, to make it easy. If I can combine it with the other numbers to get close to 56, that would work.</think>
<answer>(77 - 7) + 3 = 77 - (7 - 3) = 77 - 4 = 73 + 3 = 56</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to get close to 67 with the given numbers. Since 67 is 37 + 20 + 15, I can start with 67 and try to subtract the numbers I have:</think>
<answer>(67 - 37) - 20 = 15</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use some numbers to get close to 42. A good starting point is 31 + 14 = 45, but we have a + instead of a -. Let's change that to a subtraction:</think>
<answer>(31 - 14) + 38 - 20 = 42</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to get close to 20 using the numbers given:</think>
<answer>((11 - 85) + 96) / 2 = 22</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to get close to 72 with the numbers we have:</think>
<answer>(90 - 80) + 62 = 72</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to get close to 93 with the numbers we have.</think>
<answer>(91 + 88) - 90 = 93</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to get close to 66 using the numbers we have. Let's start by adding:</think>
<answer>(68 + 1) - 56 = 13</answer>
Now we have 13 left to reach 66. Let's try subtracting:
<answer>13 - 54 = -41</answer>
Oops, we went too far. Let's try subtracting again:
<answer>-41 + 56 = 15</answer>
This gets us very close! We're 51 short of 66. Let's try adding the last number:
<answer>15 + 54 = 69</answer>
Oh no, we went over! Let's subtract 3 to get to 66:
<answer>69 - 3 = 66</answer>
So the final equation is:
<answer>(68 + 1 - 56) + 54 - 3</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's consider using the number 56 because it's close to 66. We could subtract 1 to get closer. But 56 - 1 is 55, which is very close but not quite 66.</think>
<answer>(56 - 1) + 54 - 68 = 66</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use 80 to make progress:</think>
<answer>(80 - 56) - 61 = 16</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the largest number, 80, because it's closest to 16.</think>
<answer>(80 - 56) + 61 = 16</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try using the numbers to get as close to 38 as possible. 26 seems like a good starting point since it's close to 38.</think>
<answer>(26 - 42) + 10 - 3 = 38</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try adding two numbers:</think>
<answer>(26 - 42) + 10 - 3 = 38</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try adding some of the numbers together:</think>
<answer>(41 - 24) + 44 - 57 = 43</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use some addition and subtraction to get close to 48:</think>
<answer>(68 - 28) + 7 - 55 = 48</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to get close to 95 by combining the numbers we have:</think>
<answer>(38 + 5) * (70 - 13) = 95</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use the two largest numbers, 36 and 39, to get as close to 66 as possible. I can subtract 36 from 39 to get a difference of 3. 36 is still larger, so I can add 36 to 3 to get 39. Now I have 39 - 36 + 39 = 66. I used all the numbers exactly once.</think>
<answer>39 - 36 + 39 = 66</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try adding the largest numbers to see if I can reach 79:</think>
<answer>(88 + 66) - 57 = 79</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll think of numbers and operations that can add up to 58 using 5, 8, and 55 exactly once.</think>
<answer>(55 - 5) + 8 = 58</answer>

==============
<think>First I'll try to use some addition and subtraction to get close to 96:</think>
<answer>(86 - 23) + 33 = 96</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try adding the two smaller numbers together:</think>
<answer>(33 + 23) = 56</answer>
Now I need to get closer to 96. I can do this by subtracting a number from this sum:
<answer>56 - 86 = -30</answer>
This is not quite there, but I can make it work by adding 12 to -30:
<answer>-30 + 12 = 96</answer>
So, the final equation is:
<answer>(33 + 23 - 86) + 12 = 96</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use some addition or subtraction to get close to 87:</think>
<answer>(59 - 18) + 46 = 87</answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll try using division to get close to 56. Using 77 and 3, I can't directly reach 56. Let's try:</think>

==============
<think>First, I'll try to use each number exactly once:</think>
<answer>(77 - 3) - 7 = 56</answer>
