Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /root/.triton/autotune, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.
INFO 05-04 00:38:38 __init__.py:183] Automatically detected platform cuda.
Detected kernel version 5.4.143, which is below the recommended minimum of 5.5.0; this can cause the process to hang. It is recommended to upgrade the kernel to the minimum version or higher.
